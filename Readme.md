# Pure 11 ðŸªŸ
![Pure11 meme](./.github/pure.png)

Windows 11 arrives loaded with more than just an operating systemâ€”there's also bloatware, relentless telemetry, and a host of so-called 'features' designed to serve everyone except the end user.

Pure11 cuts through the nonsense, providing a streamlined, privacy-focused, and highly efficient version of the operating system.

This PowerShell script strips away the bloatware, removes ads, disables intrusive features, and performs essential system hardening, delivering a clean, secure, and responsive Windows 11 installation.

Pure11 is for those who prefer an OS that works for them, not the other way around.


## What is removed / changed / disabled

<details>

- **Microsoft Edge**
    
    It is purged with fire. <3

- **OneDrive**

    With a caveat: you need the post install script to get rid of it completely. It is a very persistent little worm and keeps crawling back. But after the Post install script ran, it is gone forever.

- **Telemetry**

    It's staggering how much telemetry is sewed into the fabric of Windows 11. 
    I highly doubt all of them is disabled, but the wast majority of them should be covered by Pure 11.

- **AppX Packages**

    For the latest list please check the contents of [./config/appx.conf](#)

    Please check the contents of the `./config` folder to review what changes are implemented.

## What is **NOT** removed and hence kept in a fully functional state.

<details>

 - **Windows Updates**
    
    I'm not a savage. Despite it's annoying tendency to introduce junk noone asked for, having patches for 0-days and other nasty bugs are far outweights it's downsides and shortcomings.

 - **Windows Defender**

    Well, maybe i'm a savage after all... I spent like two weeks trying to strip this out from the system in a way which doesn't undermines stability (and windows updates). 
    But it is not possible without breaking things which otherwise useful.

    If you are under age ~45 just keep your system up-to-date and don't do stupid stuff, Defender will provide sufficient protection.
    
    If you are over ~45, please purchase a strong AV engine from a reputable vendor and keep your system updated.

    I don't mean to offend anyone, but statistics and experience never lies...

    If you are looking for a good AV to purchase i recommend to check out this youtube channel:
    [The PC Security Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pcsecuritychannel) (Note: He will not tell you what to buy, but his videos will provide you the knowledge to be able to form and educated decision for your usecase/situation)

- Make sure you can run powershell scripts:
    ```powershell

## Configuration

<details>

The script can be configured using the various files in the `./config` folder (and in the `./work` folder, see below).

- ðŸ“„ **config/appx.conf**

        List of AppX packages to be removed.
        Lines starting with '#' character interpreted as comments and will be ignored.

- ðŸ“„ **config/autounattend.xml**

    Allows customization of the Setup process (among other things)

    Pure11 will try to load one which is matching with the detected language of the OS. 
    
    Allowing the option to create customized ISOs for different languages using the same "purification" process.

        Image language: en-US
            autounattend.en-US.xml will be used (if present)

        Image language: hu-HU
            autounattend.hu-HU.xml will be used (if present)

        if no language specific autounattend.xml is found then it just uses the generic one.

## Usage

<details>

1. Download the repo

2. Open powershell as admin and cd into the directory where you have the Pure11.ps1 script

3. Run the script with the -Init flag to create the required directory structure
    ```powershell
    .\Pure11.ps1 -Init
    ```

4. Use PsExec to open another powershell window as SYSTEM
    ```powershell
    psexec64.exe -nobanner -s -i powershell # for Windows powershell
    # or
    psexec64.exe -nobanner -s -i pwsh # for pwsh
    ```

5. In the freshly opened powershell window, cd into the directory where you have the Pure11.ps1 script
    ```powershell
    .\Pure11.ps1 -BuildIso
    ```

6. A file picker window will open to select your windows iso. 

    **Note:** *A notice window will also complain about not being able to find the desktop folder, that is normal and just click "Ok". SYSTEM does not have a desktop folder.*

7. In the powershell window the script will list the available SKUs (installable images / editions). Pick the one you want to proceed with.

8. The finished ISO will be placed into the iso directory right next to the script.
